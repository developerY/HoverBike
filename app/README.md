# Android XR Bike App

An immersive Android XR app built using the [Jetpack XR SDK](https://developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk). This sample app demonstrates how to create an edge-to-edge XR experience with both spatial (3D) and 2D fallback modes. It includes features such as:

- A gradient background for an immersive feel.
- Adaptive UI that switches between spatial and 2D layouts.
- A 3D model viewer that loads a glTF model asynchronously using the XR session.
- A flashy bike info panel that displays various biking metrics with pulsing animation.
- Mode switch controls to toggle between XR and full-space (or home space) modes.

## Features

- **XR Session Integration:** Uses `LocalSession` from the Jetpack XR SDK to manage XR functionality.
- **Spatial UI:** Renders immersive 3D content in a `SpatialPanel` with interactive elements.
- **2D Fallback:** Provides a simple 2D layout for devices that do not support spatial XR.
- **3D Model Loading:** Asynchronously loads a glTF model (`hover_bike/scene.gltf`) using `createGltfResourceAsync`.
- **Dynamic Bike Info Panel:** Displays metrics such as speed, distance, cadence, heart rate, altitude, calories, and power with animations and gradient effects.
- **Material3 Theming:** Utilizes Material3 components for modern, consistent design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Android Studio Meerkat or later.**
- **Android device or emulator** that supports XR features.
- **Minimum API Level:** 35 or higher.
- **Gradle:** Ensure you have an updated Gradle version that supports version catalogs.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/developerY/HoverBike.git
    cd HoverBike
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio.**

3. **Sync your project** in Android Studio to download all required dependencies.

### Running the App

1. **Build the project** using Android Studio.
2. **Deploy the app** to a compatible device or emulator.
3. **Experience the XR features**:
    - If your device supports spatial UI, youâ€™ll see a 3D scene displaying the hover bike model along with the animated bike info panel.
    - On devices without XR support, a fallback 2D layout will be presented.
